## **Table Explanation and Sources**

### **Overview**
This table compares key hardware specifications and theoretical peak performance figures for high-end Nvidia server GPUs and contemporaneous Intel Xeon CPUs from 2016 to 2024. Specs are shown for representative flagship models released in similar years.

---

### **Column Definitions**
Each column represents a single processor or GPU SKU at launch:

- **Nvidia P100, V100, A100, H100, B100:**  
  Nvidia’s highest-end server GPUs for respective years (SXM module where available).
- **Intel E7-8894 v4, Platinum 8180, Platinum 9282, Platinum 8490H, Max 6700/8500:**  
  Intel’s highest-core-count Xeon CPUs for each era.

### **Row Breakdown**

#### **Cores**
- **GPUs:** Number of CUDA cores (fundamental GPU processing elements).
- **CPUs:** Number of physical processing cores.
- **Source:** Nvidia and Intel official product pages.

#### **Threads**
- **GPUs:** Not applicable (-) as GPUs use a different model of thread distribution.
- **CPUs:** Number of hardware threads (cores × 2 for CPUs with Hyper-Threading).
- **Source:** Intel ARK database.

#### **Peak INT32 TIPS**
- **Definition:** Theoretical peak trillion integer-32 operations per second.
- **GPUs:** Nvidia’s published theoretical peak INT32 throughput, which for most architectures is similar to FP32 throughput.
- **CPUs:** Calculated as  
  *cores × base clock (GHz) × integer SIMD width (number of INT32 ops/cycle per core)*.  
  For CPUs with AVX-512, this is up to 32 INT32 ops/cycle/core; for AVX2, up to 8.
- **Sources:**  
  - Nvidia whitepapers (for GPUs)
  - Intel architecture manuals, ARK, and [Official SIMD instruction set documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/avx-512-programming-reference.html) (for CPUs)

#### **Peak FP32 TFLOPS / Peak FP64 TFLOPS**
- **Definition:** Theoretical peak trillion floating-point operations per second, single (FP32) and double precision (FP64).
- **GPUs:** Vendor-published maximums, based on internal architecture specs.
- **CPUs:** Calculated similarly to INT32 TIPS, using FMA width for floating point.
- **Sources:**  
  - Nvidia product documentation
  - Intel ARK and official whitepapers

#### **Memory Bandwidth (GB/s)**
- **Definition:** The maximum theoretical memory bandwidth per device.
- **GPUs:** HBM/HBM2/HBM3 memory controller specs, converted to GB/s.
- **CPUs:** Theoretical bandwidth for 6- or 8-channel DDR4/DDR5 at rated speeds, per socket.
- **Sources:**  
  - Nvidia datasheets  
  - Intel ARK specifications

#### **Approx. Cost (MSRP, USD)**
- **Definition:** Approximate manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) in US dollars for the device at launch; not current market prices or used prices.
- **GPUs:** Typical MSRP or confirmed large enterprise sales price for SXM modules.
- **CPUs:** MSRP for boxed server processor or reported per-unit cost.
- **Sources:**  
  - Nvidia price guidance ([Nvidia Data Center GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/))
  - Intel ARK, historical pricing reports, reseller catalogues.
  - Industry coverage inc. [Tom’s Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/), [ServeTheHome](https://www.servethehome.com/)

#### **Peak Power (W)**
- **Definition:** Thermal design power (TDP) in watts (W) per processor or GPU module.
- **GPUs:** TDP for SXM/server versions at launch; PCIe versions often lower.
- **CPUs:** Maximum TDP spec from Intel.
- **Sources:**  
  - Nvidia GPU datasheets
  - Intel ARK and SKU documentation

### **How to Verify Values**

To verify individual values, consult the following official or primary sources:

- **Nvidia GPUs:**  
  - [Nvidia Data Center GPU Product Pages](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/)
  - [Nvidia Architecture Whitepapers](https://developer.nvidia.com/)
  - [HPC benchmarks and documentation](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/)

- **Intel CPUs:**  
  - [Intel ARK Database](https://ark.intel.com/)
  - [SPEC Benchmark Results](https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/results/)
  - Processor datasheets and technical documentation

- **General Hardware Review Sites:**

  - [ServeTheHome](https://www.servethehome.com/)
  - [AnandTech](https://www.anandtech.com/)
  - [HPCWire](https://www.hpcwire.com/)

**Calculations of Peak INT32/FP32/FP64:**  
For CPUs, multiply the number of cores by the base clock frequency and the number of operations that can be performed per cycle (use AVX-512 or AVX2 width where available).  
For GPUs, use the vendor-published theoretical peak figures.
