- fundamentally based on C/C++ extensions to do the task we discussed by invoking the runtime library
- bindings to other languages, but CUDA is the native and will allow us to learn the most about how things work
- I will require that you program in C for the assignments project. You can use anything you like
- NVIDIA docs are good and the examples are good but at first might seem a little more complex
- As always, lots on the net, but be aware and also given how fast things change, GenAI can have trouble
- learning to write code and experiment is your best bet
- Competition is hot with OpenCL still the primary 
- I am told OpenCL to CUDA is very easy
- Our goal is to understand how things work, and CUDA maps very closely to the HW
