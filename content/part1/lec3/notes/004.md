- When we write out code there will always be two parts (in the same file)
- functions that we invoke from the CPU on the GPU are called kernels
- every time we invoke/launch a kernel it will spawn some number of threads
- you control both the number and how the are organized
- We must break up / organized our threads into "Thread Blocks" of no greater than 1024 threads per block
- the over all collection called a grid
- thread block is the fundamental unit by which work is assigned to a single SM (no migration)
- SM hardware will break threads into warps that can then execute in SIMD style (as discussed) on the SM's resources
