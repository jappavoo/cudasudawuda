1. Both host and device code written in C -- can live in the same file!
2. I think the simplicity of this choice and systems orientation part of CUDA's success
3. provided library / API lets you control GPU execution and manage memory : malloc and free style
4. intrinsic functions for syncronization and
5. error handling
we will look at examples of all of this

There is a detailed CUDA reference manual in addition to the programmers guide
