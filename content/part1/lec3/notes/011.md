- we invoke/launch the kernel
- looks very similar to invoking a normal function
- but we need an execution configuration to specify the organization of our threads
- one big difference to a normal function call is that a kernel invocation is ASYNC
    - returns immediately
    - work of starting the threads and running happens in parallel
    - but host execution immediately proceeds
- so this code again will compile and run
- but there is a bug do you see it?
