- In general whenever you compile a .cu you want to specify what types of PTX code and CUBIN you want to generate and leave in the fat binary
- PTX has a version that can independently change -- Virtual Architecture
- GPU real device changes with devices
- NVIDIA defines what is called the compute capability and with each generation of devices they bump the number with both major and minor bumps
