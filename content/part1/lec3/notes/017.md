- so lets tackle these in order
- CUDA strives hard to not break our C mental model
- eg. malloc becomes cudaMalloc
- but call structure modified a little for better error handling
- big thing is that CUDAmalloc returns a device address!
- still just a number but is only valid on the device
- CUDA free takes an address returned by CUDA malloc and does what you expect
- our course this is C so you must be organized and take responsibility for the mistakes you will make ;-)
